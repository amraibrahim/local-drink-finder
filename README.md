# local drink finder ‚òï

**find your perfect caf√© or boba drink based on what you're craving ‚Äî using just a zip code and AI-powered matching.**

this app uses either a locally hosted LLM (via Ollama) or Hugging Face's cloud inference API, along with Google Places API, to interpret natural language drink requests and match them to real caf√© and boba shop menus near you.

built and designed by Amra Ibrahim.
